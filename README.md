Precision Weighing Lysimeter: High Precision and Cost-Effective Solution for Soil Water Drainage and Evaporation Studies

I am freely giving away my innovative design for a lysimeter used to measure bare soil evaporation.

Complete water balance measurements with this all-in-one small scale weighing lysimeter.  Accurately reports increased mass from liquid or frozen precipitation, and decreased mass from percolation and evaporation. This lysimeter provides ±3 gram resolution, which results in ±0.01 mm water flux for a 46 cm diameter soil tank. A fiberglass wick, beneath the soil tank, provides -60 cm of tension to the base of the soil column and soil water drainage is quantified to provide water balance within the lysimeter.

A precision weighing lysimeter is a valuable tool used in soil science research to measure the water balance of a specific area. It provides accurate data on soil water drainage and evaporation, helping researchers understand the dynamics of water movement in different soil types.

One of the key advantages of this weighing lysimeter is its high precision. It is designed to measure even the smallest changes in weight, allowing researchers to accurately determine the amount of water lost through drainage or evaporation. This level of precision is essential for obtaining reliable data for scientific analysis and modeling.
Another important feature of a precision weighing lysimeter is its small scale. It is typically designed to be compact and portable, making it suitable for field studies and experiments. Researchers can easily install and monitor multiple lysimeters in different locations, enabling them to gather data from various soil types and environmental conditions.

In addition to its high precision and small scale, a precision weighing lysimeter is also a cost-effective solution. Compared to other methods of measuring soil water drainage and evaporation, such as large-scale lysimeters or complex sensor networks, precision weighing lysimeters offer a more affordable option without compromising data quality.

One of the main applications of a precision weighing lysimeter is in studying soil evaporation. By accurately measuring the amount of water lost from the soil surface, researchers can better understand the factors influencing evaporation rates, such as soil type, vegetation cover, and weather conditions. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing irrigation practices and managing water resources efficiently.

In conclusion, a precision weighing lysimeter is a valuable tool for studying soil water drainage and evaporation. Its high precision, small scale, and cost-effectiveness make it an ideal choice for researchers in the field of soil science. By providing accurate data on water movement in different soil types, it contributes to our understanding of the water balance in ecosystems and helps inform sustainable water management practices.
