# Precision Weighing Lysimeter: High Precision and Cost-Effective Solution for Soil Water Drainage and Evaporation Studies

I am freely giving away my innovative design for a lysimeter used to measure bare soil evaporation.

The SB1236 is a lysimeter with a single beam balance and a 12-inch diameter by 36-inch deep soil tank; mechanical advantage 4-times, resolution approximately 1-gram (0.04 mm flux).

The DB1818 is a lysimeter with a double beam balance and an 18-nch diameter by 18-inch deep soil tank; field adjustable mechanical advantage 14 to 29 times, resolution ~3-grams (0.02 mm flux).

This repository includes all of the details needed to build you own lysimeter.  Design details for the single beam and double beam balances are included in seperate spreadsheets, where it is possible to fine-tune the design based on soil characteristics, soil tank volume and beam lever arm mechanical advantage.  Also available are the CAD mechanical drawing including AutoCad .dwg, .dxf and .pdf files.  Some components are made from plate steel that is cut used a CNC cutting mashines; G-code for the CNC-Plasma is included.  Dataloggers are used to measure the output from the electronic loadcell and variaous other sensors (soil moisture sensors, type-T thermocouples, fluid level transducer, and submersible pump control).  Example code for variaous Campbell Scienfic dataloggers is included.

A manuscript, [_"Closing the Water Balance with a Precision Small-Scale Field Lysimeter"_](https://github.com/Lylesimeter/Post-processing-Examples), using two DB1818 lysimeters has been published _Lyles, etal. 2024_ in Senors Journal https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/7/2039
