If you are looking for a small scale, cost effective, water balance lysimeter - you've come to the right place!
I am freely giving away my innovative design for a lysimeter used to measure bare soil evaporation.
Complete water balance measurements with this all-in-one small scale weighing lysimeter.  Accurately reports increased mass from liquid or frozen precipitation, and decreased mass from percolation and evaporation. This lysimeter provides ±3 gram resolution, which results in ±0.01 mm water flux for a 46 cm diameter soil tank. A fiberglass wick, beneath the soil tank, provides -60 cm of tension to the base of the soil column and soil water drainage is quantified to provide water balance within the lysimeter.
