Precision Weighing Lysimeter: High Precision and Cost-Effective Solution for Soil Water Drainage and Evaporation Studies

I am freely giving away my innovative design for a lysimeter used to measure bare soil evaporation.

This repository includes all of the details needed to build you own lysimeter.  Design details for the single beam and double beam balances are included in seperate spreadsheets, where it is possible to fine-tune the design based on soil characteristics, soil tank volume and beam lever arm mechanical advantage.  Also available are the CAD mechanical drawing including AutoCad .dwg, .dxf and .pdf files.  Some components are made from plate steel that is cut used a CNC Plasma; G-code for the CNC-Plasma are included.  Dataloggers are used to measure the output from the electronic loadcell and variaous other sensors (soil moisture sensors, type-T thermocouples, fluid level transducer, and submersible pump control).  Example code for variaous Campbell Scienfic dataloggers is included.
